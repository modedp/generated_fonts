fonts made with the tool CustomFontRenderingForm

## Warning!
Some of these images might be moderated and will not go through, you should edit a pixel with Paint 3D (keep transparency) and try to reupload for it to go through.

## Some things that you should keep in mind
When running this script, the text placement will be accounted for on RUNTIME. If the text is not scaled, the resulting image text will be out of bounds. This is because of the font size and the frame size being accounted for. If you have a text that has one line and goes out of bounds, the frame size will make sure to contain the whole, even after the text size changes. Text scaled before Replacing = always in bound, Not Scaled before replacing = not always in bound.
